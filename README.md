---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🌑 Stealth Mode (Ninja Mode)
- **Visual:** `[ 🥷 Stealth ON ]` (Emerald Button)
- **What it does:** Makes the app completely invisible to screen recordings, Zoom, OBS, and proctoring software.
- **Why use it:** You can see the AI, but they can't.

### 2. 🧠 Dynamic Working Modes
- **New:** Switch between specialized AI personas on the fly:
  - **General**: Clear, concise, and direct answers.
  - **Writing Code**: Production-ready, optimal logic (Java/Python focus).
  - **Competitive Programming**: Optimal O(N) solutions with LeetCode-style structure. No fluff, no theory.
  - **Quiz Answer**: Maximum speed and accuracy for multiple-choice or short questions.

### 3. 🔑 Multi-Key Rotation Engine
- **What it does:** Add multiple Gemini API keys in the Setup Screen. 
- **Auto-Fallback:** If one key hits a **Quota Limit (429)** or **Permission Error (404)**, ZNinja automatically rotates to the next available key.
- **Why use it:** Bypasses rate limits and ensures 100% uptime during critical tasks.

### 4. 👻 Ghost Mode (Focus Lock)
- **Shortcut:** `Ctrl + L`
- **What it does:** Makes the window "click-through." You can interact with ZNinja, but your computer (and monitoring software) thinks you never left your browser.
- **Why use it:** Prevents "Tab Changed" or "App Switched" alerts on exam websites.

### 5. 📸 Instant AI (Vision Service)
- **Shortcut:** `Ctrl + I`
- **What it does:** Takes a silent screenshot and attaches it for analysis.
- **New:** Supports **Multi-Turn Image Analysis**. Capture consecutive screenshots to solve multi-part problems.

### 6. 🎙️ Meeting Recorder (MoM Mode)
- **Feature:** Record audio and generate professional "Minutes of Meeting" (Attendees, Agenda, Decisions, Action Items).
- **Stealth:** No tooltips or popups appear during recording to ensure clean screen capture.

## 🛠️ Advanced Stealth (Windows Only)

- **Task Manager Hiding:** The app stays hidden in **"Background processes"** as `Service Host Runtime`.
- **Taskbar Stealth:** No icon appears on the taskbar. 
- **Title-Free UI:** Tooltips and `title` attributes have been removed to prevent them from being captured in video recordings.
- **Silent Resizer:** Resize the window by dragging the bottom-right corner without the cursor changing shape.
